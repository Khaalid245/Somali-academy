# Flask Backend Project

This README provides instructions for setting up and interacting with the Flask backend project. It's primarily intended for frontend developers who need to work with this backend.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
.
├── app
│   ├── config.py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── routes.py
│   ├── static
│   └── templates
├── migrations
├── requirements.txt
└── run.py
```

- `app/`: Contains the main application code
- `migrations/`: Stores database migration files
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies
- `run.py`: The entry point to run the application

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv env
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `env\\Scripts\\activate`
   - On macOS and Linux: `source env/bin/activate`

5. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

To run the application:

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated.

2. Run the following command:
   ```
   python run.py
   ```

3. The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5000` (or another port if specified in the configuration).

## API Endpoints

The backend provides the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/resource`: Fetches a list of resources
- `POST /api/resource`: Creates a new resource
- `GET /api/resource/<id>`: Fetches a specific resource
- `PUT /api/resource/<id>`: Updates a specific resource
- `DELETE /api/resource/<id>`: Deletes a specific resource

For detailed information about request/response formats, please refer to the API documentation (if available) or consult with the backend team.

## Database Migrations

If you need to update the database schema:

1. Create a new migration:
   ```
   flask db migrate -m "Description of the changes"
   ```

2. Apply the migration:
   ```
   flask db upgrade
   ```

## Frontend Integration

To integrate this backend with your frontend:

1. Use the base URL of the running Flask application (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`) as your API base URL in your frontend configuration.

2. Make HTTP requests to the API endpoints described above. For example, to fetch all resources:

   ```javascript
   fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/resource')
     .then(response => response.json())
     .then(data => console.log(data))
     .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
   ```

3. Handle CORS: The backend should be configured to allow cross-origin requests from your frontend's domain. If you encounter CORS issues, please inform the backend team.

4. Authentication: If the API requires authentication, include the necessary headers (e.g., JWT tokens) in your requests. Consult with the backend team for specific authentication requirements.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter a "Module not found" error, ensure that your virtual environment is activated and all dependencies are installed.
- For database-related issues, check if your database is properly set up and migrations are up to date.
- If you're having trouble connecting to the API, verify that the backend server is running and that you're using the correct URL and port.
- For CORS-related issues, ensure that your frontend's domain is allowed by the backend's CORS configuration.

For any other issues or questions, please contact the backend team for support.

This README provides a comprehensive guide for frontend developers to set up and interact with your Flask backend project. It covers the project structure, setup process, running the application, API endpoints, database migrations, frontend integration, and basic troubleshooting. 

Remember to replace placeholders like `<repository-url>` and `<project-directory>` with actual values. Also, if there are any specific details about your project that I couldn't infer from the directory structure, you may want to add or modify those sections accordingly.
